        <p>
            As a passionate front-end developer, I have built a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WordPress. My journey began with the SheCodes bootcamp, where I gained hands-on experience in web development. Driven by a commitment to continuous learning, I further expanded my skills through self-directed study, utilizing resources like YouTube tutorials and contributing to various projects on GitHub.

            In addition to my web development expertise, I have a keen interest in artificial intelligence. To deepen my understanding, I pursued the AI Career Essentials (AiCE) program offered by ALX, a six-week online course designed to equip participants with fundamental AI skills. This program has enhanced my ability to integrate AI tools into my projects, aligning with industry demands and preparing me for the evolving digital landscape.
            
            My portfolio showcases a range of projects that reflect my dedication to creating engaging, user-friendly websites. I am eager to bring my technical expertise and enthusiasm for innovation to a dynamic team, contributing to impactful projects that leverage both web development and AI technologies.
